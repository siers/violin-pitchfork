- pitch
    An interactive pitchfork for violins. It analyzes samples of 8kHz
    with fftw that are recorded with SoX. Reacts on keys in G3, D4, A4, E5.

- usage
    Look at Makefile to compile it, then just `make' to start it.

- notes
    There are two builtin modes — live and sequential(as seen in fft.hs).

    Live mode has two threads and one synchronized mutable variable(MVar).
    First thread reads into mutable variable, while the other one takes the
    last 8k samples and analyzes them.

    The point of that is to make sure that we don't lag behind if too many
    samples have reached us — they'll be skipped.

    Sequential mode has one thread that sequentially analyzes all samples,
    so you'd want to use that to make it analyze something already recorded,
    e.g. `./fft < ./records/sin-440.8k.raw'
